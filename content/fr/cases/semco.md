    content: "Board meetings often seem like mysterious occasions where big
      decisions affecting workers are taken in secret. At
      [Semco](http://www.semco.com.br/en/), extra seats are available for the
      first two employees to show up. And they have full voting rights. Semco
      claims two benefits: first, it debunks some myths about boards (people
      learn these meetings are as boring as most others); second, it forces
      discussions to be pragmatic, sometimes by adding a fresh
      perspective.^[Ricardo Semler addressing Zappos all hands meeting. May
      2015.]"
