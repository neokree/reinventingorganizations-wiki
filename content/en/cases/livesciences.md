    title: "Meetings: LIVEsciences has implemented several meetings to support its
      structure."
    content: >-
      **Weekly**


      The LIVEsciences team comes together once a week for 2 hours. The first part of the Weekly

      meeting follows the Holacracy Tactical Meetings format to focus on operational work and

      operational tensions. The second part is focused on exchange and connection. In this part,

      they focus on bringing their culture and values (captured in the LIVEline*

      https://livesciences.com/liveline/) to life and reflecting on it. Team members then share how

      their week was in general e.g. on project work or upskilling. Further team members can share

      their stress level, learnings, praise, and success of the week.


      **Tension meeting**


      The one-hour tension meeting takes place every two weeks to process all emotional

      tribe-related tensions (tensions in the system). A template is used which follows the structure

      of non-violent communication. Tensions might be solved by being shared and discussed,

      specific actions to be taken, or they might be revisited again later. 


      * Tension Description  (*Observation/ My emotion with it/ My need/ My wish*)

      * From

      * Towards

      * Date of tension raise

      * Output (noted in the meeting)

      * Status

      * Date of closure


      **Governance**


      The governance meeting takes place every month for 90 minutes. Within this meeting,

      governance changes are processed by using the consent decision-making after a proposal is

      raised. Further tensions directed towards any governance topic are processed (tensions on

      the system). Proposals follow the structure of describing the tension, proposal and next steps

      to be taken. Once the proposal follows the consent decision process the governance decision

      will be implemented.


      **Orange Week Kick-Off**


      Every second-week LIVEsciences has a 1-hour meeting focusing on several financial metrics.

      Even though all numbers and metrics are transparent, this meeting ensures that information is

      understood by everyone. Furthermore, it gives room to ask questions and discuss.


      **Coffee machine meeting**


      Once a week a virtual coffee machine meeting takes place for 15 minutes for anyone that

      would like to connect with others.


      **Offsite**


      Every 4-6 weeks the LIVEsciences team meets for 2-3 days face-to-face to create belonging,

      trust, and connection within the team. This time is also used for some efficient face-to-face

      working, upskilling, or team development.


      **\*LIVEline:** The LIVEline gives an impression of the character of LIVEsciences. It summarises

      who they are and what they think is the right way of working together. For example, it includes

      values, principles, and behaviors the team is striving for and triggers passionate discussions

      on different situations in their day-to-day work life (https://livesciences.com/liveline/).

  - topic: Decision Making
    title: At LIVEsciences, there are three types of decision making.
    content: >-
      Single decision making with advice


      * Consent

      * Consensus 


      **Individual Decision Making with Advice**


      In this case, decision authority lies with the roles. Everyone is entitled to take any decision at any time – LIVEsciences team members trust each other to do the right thing no matter what. This is the most common decision at LIVEsciences and it typically involves only a few people. An example of an individual decision is deciding how to create a workshop. As a default rule, LIVEsciences uses single decision-making combined with the advice process, meaning that any person can take any decision after seeking advice from:


      * All stakeholders who will be significantly affected or at least key representatives of 
        these groups
      * People with expertise in the matter or holding relevant information for this decision,
        e.g. the “Finance Manager” role for decisions with significant out-of-pocket cost
        involved

      Advice received shall be taken into consideration. However, advice is simply advice. No 

      colleague can advise the decision-maker what to decide. With all the advice and perspectives 

      in mind, the decision-maker chooses what he/she believes is the best course of action. 

      Usually, the decision-maker is the person who notices an issue first, he/she is the owner of a specific role or he/she is affected by the issue.


      **Decision Making by Consent**


      LIVEsciences is also leveraging consent decision making. Consent means the absence of objections and going with a “good enough for now, safe enough to try” solution. When there are any objections, i.e. significant risks to the survival of the company, the decision cannot be taken, and the objections need to be dealt with (e.g., by seeking understanding or revising content).


      **Decision Making By Consensus**


      LIVEsciences has two exceptions where they switch to decision making by consensus as

      these decisions have a higher criticality to their business. Typically very few decisions require

      consensus and the number of people involved is normally higher compared to the other

      decision types:


      * Recruiting requires consensus within the panel of three colleagues

      * Purpose changes require consensus across the company
