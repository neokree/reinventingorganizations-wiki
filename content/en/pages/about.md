## About this Wiki

#### For leaders transforming their organizations...

#### And for students, academics, coaches, bloggers...

This wiki is meant as a gift for leaders who feel called to create radically more soulful and purposeful organizations (more in the wiki’s [founding charter](../founding-charter)). It is also a resource that makes next-generation practices more visible and understandable for bloggers, media students, academics, and the broader public.

#### A sharp focus on next-stage organizational practices

The wiki is founded on the idea that there are distinct evolutionary steps in the way people conceive of and run organizations. This wiki does not rehash traditional management thinking as taught in business schools. Instead, it describes  organizational structures and practices congruent with a new form of consciousness that is currently emerging in the world (sometimes called Yellow, Teal, Integral, Holistic, Authentic, or Networked).

#### A volunteer driven, self-governing wiki

This body of knowledge is brought to the world by [a group of enthusiastic volunteers](/pages/a-group-of-enthusiastic-volunteers) inspired by the ideas presented in the book, “[Reinventing Organizations](https://www.reinventingorganizations.com/)” and the video series “[Insights for the Journey](https://thejourney.reinventingorganizations.com/index.html)” (both by Frederic Laloux). The community of wiki contributors operates itself—how could it be otherwise?—using next-generation practices that the wiki discusses.
