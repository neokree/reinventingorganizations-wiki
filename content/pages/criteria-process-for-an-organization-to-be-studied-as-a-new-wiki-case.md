### Important introduction

This list of criteria / decision is an INITIAL framework for our team to work with. 

ANYBODY inside the wiki team decide to continue this conversation, enrich the ideas feeding the initial decisions, and carry foward the product of a 2.0 or later release of this page.

## Decisions on Criteria / Process for an Organization to be studied and included as a new Wiki case (V.1.0)

1. Organization ideal profile (see below exceptions to this) : 

   * Minimum 100 persons working for the organization
   * At least 5 years since the start of the Teal journey
   * At least 2 from the 3 main focuses (Evolutionary purpose, wholeness, self-management)
   * Top manager of the organization supports the case information, and he/she is open to further questions.
   * Prefer organizations that are under-represented inside the wiki (e.g. public sector) or have practices that are less illustrated (e.g. Self-management !)
