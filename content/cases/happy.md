introduction: >
  Happy was founded in the UK by Henry Stewart as Happy Computers in Dec 1987.
  The aim was to make learning about software an enjoyable experience.


  A key turning point was in 1992 when Henry read Maverick by Ricardo Semler and realised that organisations could be based on trust and freedom.


  In the 2000s the company expanded into leadership and personal development and changed its name to Happy.


  Another key turning point came in 2017 when the company adopted the ideas of David Marquet and the two key leaders decided to make no decisions. The company expanded by 20% annually in the years following.


  As of 2021 Happy provides IT training, leadership and personal development and apprenticeships and seeks to create happy, productive workplaces.


  In 2021 Happy employs 25 permanent staff and around 50 associates. Its turnover is around £2.2 million

      You can’t say there is no hierarchy at Happy, as there are two clear
      leaders: Henry Stewart, founder and Chief Happiness Officer, and Cathy
      Busani, Managing Director. However there isn’t a rigid structure.


      There are three departments: Happy Computers (IT Training), Happy People (leadership and personal development) and apprenticeships (funded in the UK by an Apprenticeship levy that every organisation has to pay).


      Each department does have a Head but it is not necessarily a relationship between them and the people in those departments. Each person chooses who they would like to be their “M&M”. The title M&M was chosen by the staff and means Multiplier and Mentor - although the role is more of a coach.


      Where staff work in a team, there is a team job description, rather than individual ones. That means that people can choose which roles in the team they want to play and these often shift.


      There is a regular staff meeting (fortnightly before the pandemic, weekly during it). This will decide anything that affects everybody.


      There is also a monthly Joyful meeting. This includes Henry, the heads of department and people elected by the staff as “potential leaders”. Anybody can attend this meeting.

      Wherever possible the teams make their own decisions, without referring to the head of that department.


      [Happy’s organisation chart](https://happycomputers-my.sharepoint.com/:p:/g/personal/henry_happy_co_uk/ETTTuvaVZXJDpRhWRah6GpwBTNJr5kaEibA8LAcUfR5WPA?e=dm91fe) is a series of circles with the picture of the person inside. It includes:


      * Job title

      * When they work

      * Whether they are an activist, pragmatist, reflector or theorist  ([Honey and Mumford](https://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/doctoralcollege/training/eresources/teaching/theories/honey-mumford))

      * Their 5 key strengths based on Strengthfinder (R)


      The colours show their communication style, 


      * when at ease (external circle) and 

      * when under pressure (internal circle). 



      * Red = Driver, 

      * Yellow = Expressive, 

      * Green = Amiable, 

      * Blue = Analytical


      The arrows indicate who coaches who.

      The chart is the work of two front-line staff who were pre-approved to come up with it.
