introduction: >
  Happy was founded in the UK by Henry Stewart as Happy Computers in Dec 1987.
  The aim was to make learning about software an enjoyable experience.


  A key turning point was in 1992 when Henry read Maverick by Ricardo Semler and realised that organisations could be based on trust and freedom.


  In the 2000s the company expanded into leadership and personal development and changed its name to Happy.


  Another key turning point came in 2017 when the company adopted the ideas of David Marquet and the two key leaders decided to make no decisions. The company expanded by 20% annually in the years following.


  As of 2021 Happy provides IT training, leadership and personal development and apprenticeships and seeks to create happy, productive workplaces.


  In 2021 Happy employs 25 permanent staff and around 50 associates. Its turnover is around Â£2.2 million
