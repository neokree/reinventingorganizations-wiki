      A few years ago, the HR department in Jaipur Rugs was renamed “*The Search for Divine Soul*”. The company believes that all people are unique in their own way and their sense of purpose can add to the company’s higher purpose. Recruitment is based on how candidate can add to company values. Interview questions are designed to learn about candidates’ purpose and principles—rather than focusing on experience and academic background. The founder is directly involved in this process, and often takes the final interview. Managers at Head Office do the initial interviews. Final decisions are made by consensus of all stakeholders.

    title: An Artisan Engagement Program
    content: Onboarding programs are immersive and extensive. They offer induction
      for joiners and run up to 5 days.  There they learn about every vertical
      from the grassroots (villages) to the head office. This includes even the
      artisans. HR department arranges for representatives from each department
      to present about their work, so each new joiner gets a common
      understanding. A lot of resources, including videos, and business process
      are shown and explained. The Artisan Engagement Program ensures they have
      a holistic understanding of the company and its business model.

    title: Learning together
    content: >-
      Training is an essential part of the development programs both for
      grassroots (villages) and head office people. 

      In 2020, Jaipur Rugs completed a leadership training session based on the founder’s ‘mentality model’. This training helped everyone to share best practices (including self-management) from around the world. The leadership department takes care of this training, which is offered regularly to ensure good participation. 

      The company has formed teams to learn self-management in various ways, including participation in webinars & forums, and small experiments in the teams.
