introduction: >-
  Reddico is a digital marketing agency based in the UK, founded in 2012 and
  predominantly focusing on SEO services. It wasn’t until 2017 that the business
  began a cultural revolution to reinvent the framework of the company – which
  at the time was led by a desire to become a better place to work for everyone.


  A manifesto was created, outlining six key areas of change – and subsequently rolled out over a 9-month period in 2018. Although unknowingly, Reddico had already started to incorporate some of the key elements of Teal and has since continued to build and expand on a company culture that puts trust, freedom, and responsibility at the heart of everything. 


  Some of the core changes include removing managers, creating a work ‘anywhere, anytime, anyway you want’ policy, and stripping back traditional processes such as budgets and annual appraisals.

    title: A sociocratic framework, with Teal principles
    content: >-
      Reddico’s structure uses the principles of Teal, with a formalized model
      taking the shape of a typical sociocratic framework. 


      All departments and teams are self-managed – each group then decides how it will operate (how often meetings will be, how information will be shared, who will be part of that group etc.). Information from team meetings is distributed to the whole company (radical transparency), with the majority of the team working on the current 90-days. 


      Each team also elects a representative for wider circle discussions (for instance, Operations). Information is then able to flow throughout the organization.

      **Training**

      Everyone at Reddico can decide how they want to push their career forward. There is no fixed training budget, meaning the team can spend what they need to enhance their skills and expertise. 


      The only caveat is they must use the advice process. 


      Reddico also has a career matrix and marketplace salary research available for most departments. The career matrix highlights the skills, experience, and knowledge needed from an entry role through to senior positions in the company. The team self-manage their matrix, again using the advice process if they want to complete a section.

      **Coaching**

      As a manager-less environment, the team can self-manage everything. However, to promote reflection and progression, a coaching set-up has been created. The team is able to choose their own coach (from those who’ve put themselves forward) and schedule sessions to discuss anything that‘s on their mind, or any challenges they’re facing. 


      Coaching is on the individual to decide when and if they need to book a session – as with everything else, it’s completely self-managed. The only two requirements are that an individual choose someone from OUTSIDE their department, and there’s the minimum of a quarterly coaching session (inspired by Happy’s process).

  - topic: Commitment, Working Hours and Flexibility
    title: Freedom & trust – just make a positive impact
    content: >-
      Reddico operates as a completely self-managed company, where individuals
      are accountable for how, when, and where they work best. The following
      applies:


      * **No set number of days holiday each year**. Everyone has to take a MINIMUM of 28 days (including Bank Holidays), but outside of that it’s up to the individual.

      * **Choose where you work**. This could be 100% remote, 100% in the office, or a hybrid of the two. Reddico also supports individuals who want to move abroad permanently or temporarily. 

      * **Choose the hours you work.** There are no core hours, and team members are able to decide the best times for them. It could be 6am or 11pm – whatever works for you. 

      * **Pay all sick days**. Reddico trusts the team to be open and honest. If you’re sick, take time off to get back to 100%. 


      The only caveat to all of this is ‘*you must make a positive impact’*.
  - topic: Feedback and Performance Management
    title: No managers. Just choose your own coach.
    content: >-
      With the removal of managers from the company, Reddico also scrapped
      traditional management responsibilities such as annual appraisals and
      performance reviews. 


      This type of performance review has been replaced with quarterly check-ins with your own coach – each individually picked by the team member. The check-ins are designed to create a positive, reflective experience, discussing areas such as success, aspirations, values, and job role happiness.

  - topic: Decision Making
    title: Clear roles and responsibilities with the advice process
    content: >-
      Each team has built out the roles and responsibilities of everyone in the
      group, so it’s clear who would be able to make decisions within the
      company on different subjects. 


      If a responsibility falls into an individual’s area, they’re able to direct change and improvement using the advice process.
